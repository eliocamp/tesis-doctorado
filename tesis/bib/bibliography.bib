  abstract = {The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the main mode of variability in the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropical circulation and it is so called because of its zonally symmetric ring-like shape. However, the SAM pattern actually contains noticeable deviations from zonal symmetry. Thus, the purpose of this study is to describe the zonally asymmetric and symmetric components of the SAM variability and their impacts. We regress monthly geopotential height fields at each level onto the asymmetric and symmetric component of the SAM to create two new indices: Asymmetric SAM (A-SAM) and Symmetric SAM (S-SAM). In the troposphere, the A-SAM is associated with a zonal wave 3 which is rotated a quarter wavelength with respect to the climatological zonal wave 3, is much stronger in the Pacific ocean, where it extends vertically to the stratosphere with an equivalent barotropic structure. On the other hand, the S-SAM is associated with negative geopotential height anomalies over Antarctica surrounded by a zonally symmetric ring of positive geopotential height anomalies. The observed relationship between the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation and the SAM is fully explained by the A-SAM index. The positive trend of the SAM is present only in its symmetric component. Despite this, the SAM is becoming more zonally asymmetric. The regional impacts of the SAM in temperature and precipitation are strongly affected by its asymmetric component. We show that the asymmetric component of the SAM has its own unique variability, trends and impacts, some of these signals are only evident when the two SAM components are separated.},

  abstract = {A more complete and new formulation of the orographic forcing and new thermal forcings are included in a steady state model of the Northern Hemisphere planetary waves. When both forcings are included, the simulation produces excellent results which are compared in detail with observations. In particular, the Siberian high, the tropospheric East Asian trough and subtropical tropospheric East Asian jet stream maxima are well reproduced even though the forcing is primarily extratropical in origin. The modes uses a lower boundary condition in which the orographic forcing is determined by the effects of the total flow, not just the zonal mean basic state. Consequently, the net orographic forcing changes when thermal forcing is added and the tow solution is not equal to the linear sum of the solutions with orographic and thermal forcings separately. The thermally induced orographic forcing is found to be very significant and, in the troposphere, there is strong interaction between the two forcings with both of roughly equal importance. However, the Iowa-latitude vertically propagating waves am deflected by the subtropical jet and absorbed in the low-latitude easterlies. Thus only the mid-high latitude planetary waves are important in the stratosphere which seems to be dominated by the thermally forced component. The model is forced with new estimates of diabetic heating from several FGGE analyses. The sensitivity of the results to different heatings and their assumed vertical profile is examined. The amplitude of the lower-troposphere response is very sensitive to the vertical profile but there are much smaller changes at upper levels which are dominated by the remote response. Large differences in the response to the different diabatic heatings are found at high latitudes and over the Pacific Ocean. However, when orographic forcing is also included, these differences diminish indicating a smaller sensitivity to uncertainties in heating, and thus the orographic forcing is acting to constrain the total response. This is in marked contrast to the model results when the traditional lower-boundary condition (in which the waves are decoupled) is used since then the total response is entirely linear. Wave 1 is too weak in the model and this is most likely mainly due to deficiencies in the thermal forcing. The model eddy fluxes of heat and momentum show excellent agreement with observations in location although the poleward heat flux is somewhat weak. These reveal noticeable improvements over the wave-decoupled model which produces too large a response with the lower-tropospheric heat flux too far south at 35\textdegree N in association with a degraded simulation of the Siberian high and East Asian trough, in particular.},

  abstract = {There are two pervasive modes of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) that influence circulation and rainfall anomalies over South America. They appear as leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of 500-hPa height or 200-hPa streamfunction anomalies and are found from intraseasonal to decadal time scales. Both patterns exhibit wave 3 hemispheric patterns in mid to high latitudes, and a well-defined wave train with large amplitude in the Pacific\textendash South American (PSA) sector. Therefore, they are referred to as the PSA modes (PSA1 and PSA2). PSA1 is related to sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) over the central and eastern Pacific at decadal scales, and it is the response to El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the interannual band. The associated rainfall summer pattern shows rainfall deficits over northeastern Brazil and enhanced rainfall over southeastern South America similar to rainfall anomalies during ENSO. PSA2 is associated with the quasi-biennial component of ENSO, with a period of 22\textendash 28 months and the strongest connections occur during the austral spring. The associated rainfall pattern shows a dipole pattern with anomalies out of phase between the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) extending from central South America into the Atlantic and the subtropical plains centred at 35\textdegree S. These two modes are also apparent in tropical intraseasonal oscillations for both summer and winter. Eastward propagation of enhanced convection from the Indian Ocean through the western Pacific to the central Pacific is accompanied by a wave train that appears to originate in the convective regions. The positive PSA1 pattern is associated with enhanced convection over the Pacific from 150\textdegree E to the date line. The convection pattern associated with PSA2 is in quadrature with that of PSA1. Both PSA modes are influenced by the Madden Julian Oscillation and influence rainfall over South America.

  abstract = {The focus of this Paper is on the frequency and spatial distributions of blocking and persistent anomalies of geopotential height over the Southern Hemisphere. The analysis is based upon daily height fields at 1000 and 500 mb for both summer and winter. Histogram frequency distributions of height anomalies and maps of the skewness and kurtosis have been computed. Blocking events are objectively defined by requiring a large positive anomaly to exist for 5 days or more. Composite flow and anomaly fields for several cases are presented and examined in detail. The geographical distribution of the frequency of lame amplitude {$\geqslant$}150 gpm anomalies at 500 mb that persist for only 1\textendash 3 days is very similar to that of the high-frequency band (2\textendash 8 day period) variances that identity the storm tracks in the Southern Hemisphere. The primary location for blocking in the Southern Hemisphere is in the New Zealand sector and blocking occurs through a local enhancement of the climatological split in the mean westerlies on a spatial scale of 60\textdegree{} longitude. Other maxima occur southeast of South America and over the southern Indian Ocean. Sporadically, multiple blocking events occur at more than one location and one triple blocking event is examined in detail. Zonal wave 3 is strongly evident in such cases; it also plays a dominant role in the majority of blocking events. However, on most occasions, blocking occurs in isolation as a local phenomenon, and it appears that the local wave 3 may be but part of a wave train with a great circle rather than zonal orientation. Transient eddies appear to play an important role in sustaining a blocking event by either continually reinforcing the anticyclone on its western flank or by quickly reestablishing a new anticyclone as the old one breaks down or moves away.},

  abstract = {We investigate variability and trends of the Southern Hemisphere quasi-stationary planetary waves over 1979\textendash 2013 using the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim reanalyses. The effects of tropical and extra-tropical forcing factors on the phase and amplitude of the planetary waves are identified. The amplitudes of wave numbers 1\textendash 3 exhibit an annual cycle with a minimum in summer and maximum over the extended austral winter period. The phase of wave number 1 has a semi-annual cycle, moving east in austral spring/autumn and west in summer/winter as a result of differences in the phase of the semi-annual oscillation across the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The phase of wave number 3 has an annual cycle, being more eastward (westward) in summer (winter). Year-to-year variability of the amplitude of wave number 1 is found to be strongly associated with the Amundsen Sea Low, which in turn is known to be strongly influenced by the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation, with the consequence that the amplitude of wave number 1 is larger during the El Ni\~no phase of the cycle. Regarding trends for the year as a whole, the amplitude of wave number 1 has decreased since 1979 (p {$<$} 0.1), while the amplitudes of wave numbers 2 and 3 have increased. These changes are consistent with the warming trends in sea surface temperatures across much of the tropical oceans. However, the factors associated with longer-term trends are less clear than for year-to-year variability.},
