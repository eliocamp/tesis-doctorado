**Dynamics of the Southern Hemisphere zonally asymmetric circulation**

The goal of this work is to better understand the asymmetric zonal circulation in the Southern Hemisphere on seasonal and longer time scales.
To do this, we used data from ERA5 reanalysis and historical simulations from CMIP6.
We calculated Complex Empirical Orthogonal Functions (cEOFs) of geopotential height zonal anomalies at 200 hPa and 50 hPa, which allowed us to describe variability patterns with phase and amplitude.

We identified two main modes: cEOF1, which represents the variability of zonal wave 1 in the stratosphere and is related to ozone anomalies, and cEOF2, which describes a wave pattern of 3 with maximum magnitude in the Pacific, related to the PSA modes.
Only cEOF2 has impacts on surface temperature and precipitation.

We separated the variability of the SAM into its zonally symmetric (S-SAM) and asymmetric (A-SAM) parts.
The 90ยบ phase of cEOF2 is highly correlated with A-SAM, suggesting that they may describe the same phenomenon or that A-SAM could be a statistical contamination of the PSA mode in a more zonally symmetric SAM.

Finally, we analyzed these modes in historical simulations from CMIP6 and found that the models' ability to represent these modes varies greately among the models, but the multi-model average represents the modes adequately.
However, most models exaggerate the relationship between the modes and sea surface temperature.
