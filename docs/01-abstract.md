This work aims to advance in the characterization and understanding of the zonally asymmetric circulation of the Southern Hemisphere at seasonal and longer time scales.
To achieve this, we analyzed ERA5 data and historical runs from CMIP6.

We computed Complex Empirical Orthogonal Functions (cEOFs) of geopotential height zonal anomalies at 200 hPa and 50 hPa.
These are similar to traditional EOFs but allow us to characterize patterns that have both phase and amplitude.

cEOF1 represents the variability of zonal wave 1 in the stratosphere and is closely associated with ozone anomalies.
cEOF2, on the other hand, represents a wave-3 pattern with maximum magnitude in the Pacific sector, which turns out to be an alternative description of the PSA modes.
The analysis of this mode indicates that it is an internal variability mode of the subtropical atmosphere that takes a preferential phase in response to tropical forcing.
Only cEOF2 is associated with surface impacts.

To study the relationship between these modes of variability of the asymmetric circulation and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which primarily represents symmetric variability, we separated SAM variability into its zonally symmetric (S-SAM) and asymmetric (A-SAM) components.
Based on the separation of SAM into S-SAM and A-SAM, we observed that the 90ยบ phase of cEOF2 has an extremely high correlation with A-SAM, suggesting that, either both methodoloties capture the same phenomenon, or that the asymmetric part of SAM may actually be a statistical contamination of the PSA mode in a more zonally symmetric SAM.

Finally, we analyzed these modes of variability in historical CMIP6 runs.
We found that the representation of these modes varies greatly among models and even among members of the same model.
However, the multimodel mean represents the modes very well.
Nonetheless, most models exaggerate the relationship between these modes and sea surface temperature.
